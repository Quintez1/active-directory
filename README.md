<h1>Lab - Azure Compute and Networking</h1>

- Simple Steps and Description:
  
We're going to set up some virtual computers (VMs) in the cloud using Azure. We'll create a Windows computer and a Linux computer, and then we'll use a tool called Wireshark to see how data moves between them.

- Create a Resource Group: Think of this as a folder where we'll keep our cloud computers.
- Create a Windows 10 VM: Make a virtual Windows computer.
- Create a Linux (Ubuntu) VM: Make a virtual Linux computer.
- Observe Your Virtual Network: Check how these computers are connected in the cloud.
  
This lab focuses on creating and managing Azure virtual machines (VMs) and understanding network traffic using tools like Wireshark. You'll create both Windows and Linux VMs, observe different types of network traffic (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, and RDP), and understand how network security groups (NSGs) can affect this traffic. This lab will help you build fundamental skills in Azure computing and networking, and how to analyze and secure network traffic.<br />
