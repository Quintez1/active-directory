<h1>Lab - Azure Active Directory</h1>

- Simple Steps and Description:

We'll set up a system called Active Directory on a cloud server. This helps manage users and computers in a network.

- Create a Domain Controller: Make a Windows Server in the cloud to manage the network.
- Create a Client Computer: Make a Windows 10 computer in the cloud to join the network.
- Install Active Directory: Set up Active Directory on the server.
- Create User Accounts: Make accounts for different users.
- Join the Client Computer to the Domain: Connect the Windows 10 computer to the network

This lab focuses on deploying Active Directory in an Azure environment. You'll set up a Domain Controller and a client machine, configure Active Directory Domain Services, create user accounts, and join the client machine to the domain. This project helps you gain practical experience in managing and deploying Active Directory for user and resource management. <br />
